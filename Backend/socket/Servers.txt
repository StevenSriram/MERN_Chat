Express : 

    - express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies handling
      HTTP requests (e.g., serving HTML files, handling routes, etc.)

    - But Express alone canâ€™t handle real-time communication 


SOCKET IO : 

    - socket.io lets you send and receive messages in real time
      (like chat apps or live notifications)

    -  But Socket.IO needs an HTTP server to work 
        because it uses the same connection as your website

    
HTTP Module :

    - The HTTP server (created using `http.createServer`)
      is like a bridge between Express and Socket.IO

    - It lets 
        . Express handle normal web stuff (like serving your HTML file) and
        . Socket.IO handle real-time stuff (like chat messages).
